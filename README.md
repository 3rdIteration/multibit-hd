### MultiBit HD

A Bitcoin wallet based on the Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) mode to provide very fast blockchain synchronization.
Public and private keys are held in a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet to provide much greater security than traditional
desktop clients. Support for external hardware wallets (such as the Trezor) is available.

### Technologies

* [Bitcoinj](https://code.google.com/p/bitcoinj/) - Providing various Bitcoin protocol utilities
* [Java HID API](https://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/) - Java library providing USB Human Interface Device (HID) native interface
* [Google Protocol Buffers](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) (protobuf) - For use with communicating with the Trezor device

### Project status
