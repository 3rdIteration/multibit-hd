<h4>How to install on Windows</h4>

<p><strong>Please note that for security reasons we do not support Windows XP and below.</strong></p>

<h4 id="windows7">Running Windows 7 and higher?</h4>

<p>This is the default "64-bit" installer and is suitable for Windows 7 (and some editions of Vista) and higher.</p>

<p>Double click the installer - it is signed by KeepKey, LLC. Work through the installer - accepting the defaults is normally the
  easiest.</p>
<p>If you have a firewall set up when you first open MultiBit you will be asked by Windows if you want MultiBit to communicate over your internet connection. MultiBit
  needs to communicate with the Bitcoin network and the multibit.org server so permit this access.</p>

<h4 id="vista">Running Windows Vista?</h4>

<p>We don't support Windows Vista. You <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/categoryID.70036700?=en_US_Store_UH_software_Win" target="_blank">should consider upgrading</a>
    to take advantage of the latest security fixes.</p>

<p>The installation process is the same as for the 64-bit version.</p>

<h4 id="xp">Running Windows XP?</h4>

<p>We don't support Windows XP. It has <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/cybertrust/2013/08/15/the-risk-of-running-windows-xp-after-support-ends-april-2014/" target="_blank">too many security issues to be viable
  for Bitcoin software</a> outside of a highly controlled environment.</p>

<h4 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>Occasionally people encounter problems getting MultiBit set up on their Windows machine. Here are some common solutions to known problems.</p>

<h5>I don't have much system memory</h5>

<p>MultiBit uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to manage its memory. This means that over time you will see memory use increase as various activities take place.
  Synchronizing with the block chain is a memory-intensive process and during the initial sync or a Repair Wallet operation you will notice an increase. By default MultiBit
  will not consume more than the <em>lesser</em> of one quarter of your system memory or 1Gb. For example, on a 2Gb system (2009 mid-range machine) MultiBit will start having
  memory constraints at around 500Mb.</p>

<p>This default is sufficient to allow for smooth and responsive operations on most systems. However, MultiBit can continue to work with only 256Mb allocated to it although
  performance tends to reduce.</p>

<p>If you want to change the memory allocated to MultiBit you will need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>After installation, locate the MultiBit shortcut</li>
  <li>Right click and select "Properties"</li>
  <li>Edit the Target line by adding <code>-J-Xmx1024m</code> including a space after the final <code>"</code> to set a 1Gb limit (e.g.Target:
    <code>"C:\Program Files\MultiBit HD\multibit-hd.exe" -J-Xmx1024m</code></li>
  <li>Save the changes and use the shortcut as normal to start MultiBit</li>
</ol>
