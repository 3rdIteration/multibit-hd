/**
 * <p>Factory to provide the following to UI:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Provision of different wizards targeting various use cases</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Overview of the Wizard architecture</h3>
 *
 * <p>A wizard presents a series of panels enclosed in a light box. This is in contrast to the
 * standard modal dialog approach offered by Swing which is more limited and offers less customisation
 * opportunities.</p>
 *
 * <p>From a data perspective each wizard consists of one "wizard model" which has many "panel models"
 * each of which have many "component models". Components are reused across panels and so do not maintain
 * a back reference to a parent panels but instead use a <code>WizardComponentModelChangedEvent</code> to
 * inform all interested panels that their data has changed. Events are filtered by the panel name to prevent
 * collisions.</p>
 *
 * <p>A "wizard view" has a consistent layout: a title and description (top), some components (middle) and a row of
 * buttons (bottom). The top and bottom rows are handled mainly by boilerplate code leaving just the presentation
 * and management of the middle section to the developer.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Quickly assembling a wizard</h3>
 *
 * <p>The quickest way to get a wizard up and running is to take an existing one and modify it accordingly. If
 * your requirement is straightforward (no MaV components or reliance on previous panels) then the boilerplate
 * will handle all the work for you.</p>
