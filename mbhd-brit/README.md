### Burton-Rowe Income Technique (BRIT) README

This project provides a means to collect small payments from many users efficiently.

There is more documentation, including overviews in the src/main/doc directory.


### Dependencies

The usual code dependencies are defined in Maven.

There are two tools you will need to have available on your system as follows:

+ GPG is used to generate PGP keypairs
+ MultiBit Classic is used to generate Bitcoin ECkeypairs and a wallet.

You could use other tools but the 'how-to' documentation uses these tools as a baseline.
