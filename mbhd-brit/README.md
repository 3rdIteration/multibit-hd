### Burton-Rowe Income Technique (BRIT) README

This project provides a means to collect small payments from many users efficiently.

Please refer to the [BRIT server GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitcoin-solutions/brit-server) for all technical documentation.

### Dependencies

The usual code dependencies are defined in Maven.

There are two tools you will need to have available on your system as follows:

* GPG is used to generate a PGP key pair for the Matcher server
* MultiBit Classic is used to generate Wallets for the Redeemers.

You could use other tools but the 'how-to' documentation uses these tools as a baseline.
